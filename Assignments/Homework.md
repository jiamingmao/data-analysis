# Homework Guidelines

## General

- Each assignment will be graded on a 0 - 4 scale.
    - Truly exceptional assignment may get a 5 and will be posted on the course repo.
- Up to two people are allowed to work on the same assignment. The assignment will have two authors.
- You can write your assignment in either English or Chinese.

## Format
You can submit your assignment in two ways:
1. compile your assignment to `pdf` or `html` and submit on Moodle
2. upload your assignment to your personal github repo and provide a _viewable link_ to the file on Moodle.

Extra points (+0.5) for:
- writing in `LaTeX`
    - see [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/blob/master/Materials/Software/LaTex/LaTex.md).
- writing in `markdown`, including:
    - `R markdown`: see [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Resources/#rr-markdown)
    - `Stata markdown`: see [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Resources/#stata)
- writing in `Jupyter notebook`
    - see [here](https://jupyter.org/) and [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) for instructions. see [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#statistics-machine-learning-and-data-science) for examples.
    - here is an entire course written in `jupyter notebooks`: [Computational Statistics and Statistical Computing](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2018/index.html) (also an excellent course you can check out)
- publishing on your own github page
    - see [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/blob/master/Materials/Software/Git%20and%20Github/Git%20and%20Github.md) for instructions. see [here](https://sudongqi.github.io/) for an example.

Extra points (+1) for: completing a challenge satisfactorily.

*note 1*: if two people co-author an assignment, **both** need to submit it using one of the methods above.

*note 2*: if you upload your assignment to github, you need to supply a _viewable link_. This means that the instructor needs to be able to click the link and immediately review your assignment (rather than having to download any files and open them). In practice, this means that:
 - `pdf`, plain `markdown`, and `jupyter notebook` (.ipynb) files can be viewed on github directly, hence a link directly to the file works.
 - `html` files cannot be viewed on github directly. So if you have got an `html` file, you need to generate a viewable link using the [github html viewer](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).
 - `R markdown`, `Stata markdown` etc. cannot be viewed on github directly and need to be compiled to `pdf` or `html`

## Theoretical Report

Write a short report (1 - 2 pages) on a lecture-related topic.

*Suggestions*: Other than the lecture slides, the "[notes and resources](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Lectures/)" page contains additional readings and materials for each lecture that should be helpful for you in choosing a topic as well as in your writing.

*Important*: you should write as if your target audience is your fellow students, *not* me. In other words, imagine you are writing a tutorial for your fellow students and try to be as clear as possible.

## Method Demonstration

Writing a report demonstrating a method introduced in or relevant to the lecture. Possibilities include:
- Implement a method using simulated data
- translate an example in class into an alternative language

Examples: [[1](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics/blob/master/Homework/intro_regression.html)], [[2](https://github.com/philippbauch/simple-linear-regression-notebook/blob/master/linear-regression-demo.ipynb)]

## Empirical Analysis

Analyze real data using a method introduced in or relevant to the lecture.

For sources of data, see [here](https://github.com/jiamingmao/data-analysis/tree/master/Materials/Data) and [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/data-analysis/Resources/#miscellaneous). You are also encouraged to use the data you are using in your own research.

## Academic Integrity
- You **must** reference any sources you used in your writing using proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL)
- You **must** acknowledge any sentences or codes that are not written by yourself.
- Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity. If it is found that you used sources without proper reference, you will get a zero for your homework the first time and you will fail the course the second time.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- I am an undergraduate student and I just learned what "probability" means for the first time last week. Are my assignments going to be graded under the same criteria as those of graduate students? Would that be unfair?
    - Whether an assignment is written by one student or two students, by undergraduate or graduate students, will be not be a factor of consideration in initial evaluation. However, at the end of the semester, your homework grades will be adjusted to reflect your proper academic level and contribution. This means that if you are an undergraduate student or if you write your homework alone, your grades will be bumped up at the end of the semester. Conversely, this means if you are a graduate student or if you work in groups of two, you need to do a better job!


- I do not have any friends. I expect to do all the homework by myself. Are my assignments going to be graded under the same criteria as those that are the results of collaboration? Would that be unfair?
    - See above. Also: get a friend.
